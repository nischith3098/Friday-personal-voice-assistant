# Friday-personal-voice-assistant
This repo has the code for the development of personal voice assistant

This Python script defines a voice assistant program that listens to the user's voice commands and executes the corresponding actions. The program uses several Python libraries, including speech_recognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit, datetime, wikipedia, pyjokes, and webbrowser.

When the program is executed, it will initialize the text-to-speech engine and greet the user according to the current time. Then, it will listen to the user's voice commands using the speech recognition library and execute the corresponding actions based on the keywords included in the user's command.

The program can perform several actions, including playing a video on YouTube, telling the current time, defining a term using Wikipedia, telling a joke, opening Google or YouTube in a web browser, finding synonyms or antonyms of a word using PyMultiDictionary. When the program receives a command, it will print the output on the console and speak it using the text-to-speech engine. If the program is not able to execute the command, it will print and speak an error message.
